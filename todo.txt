Peter:

- Geometric "traditional" perception of book position (ICP):
1. Point clouds are translated to actual book position (reason for that is that context is not used and simulation is advanced).
How do I fix that?
2. Cropping of point cloud: so far, we do it by hand (this is okay but not very generalizable).
3. 

- Understand GroundingDINO
Goal: allow for two prompts:
1. Prompt: "the first book on table".
2. Prompt: "empty/taken shelf compartment"
(- Perception of book label (deep perception))
(- Antipodal grasping)


Shiva:
- adding book labels
- Adding the robot, i.e. Best way of making a scenario out of urdf? Something like this:

scenario_data = """

    name: mobile_iiwa
